2. Writing a program to check whether a given string, word, or number is a palindrome.
3. Writing a program to check whether a value/target exists in an ascending array in O(log n) time complexity.
4. Writing a program to count the total number of vowels in a given string.
5. Writing a program to print the factorial of any given number.
